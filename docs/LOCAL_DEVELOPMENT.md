# Local Development

This document provides guidelines and instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine

- Node.js (v20.x or later)
- npm (v10.x or later)
- AWS CLI (configured with appropriate credentials)
- SST CLI (optional, you can work with the node_modules copy).

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ecarrizo2/media-accessibility.git
   cd media-accessibility
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   For now this project do not have a `.env` variables (will expand this docs when ready), but you can find the
   environment variables in the sst.config.ts at the `ENVIRONMENT` const until then.

4. **Set up AWS Secrets**:
   Ensure you have the necessary secrets set up in AWS Parameter Store,
   currently there is only one secret used in the project to connect with OpenAPI,
   if you do not have an account, you can use mocked responses in the service instead of implementing the service class

   ```
   sst secret set OpenaiApiKey "your-openai-api-key"
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the SST local development environment**:

   ```
   sst dev
   ```

2. **Access the local API**:
   Once the SST environment is running, you can access the local API at the URL provided in the console output.

3. **Debugging Locally**:
   When running the project as `sst dev` it will create a watcher, and you will
   be able to see the logs in your cli and update your dev deployment as files changes in your project.

   Additionally, if you want to use the sst console `https://console.sst.dev` it will
   provide you with a visual representation of your local environment and comprehensive features
   to debug your project deployed in the cloud.
