# SST OOP Starter Kit
The SST OOP Starter Kit is a boilerplate designed for building enterprise-grade serverless applications using the Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST). It incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, lightweight dependency injection with TSyringe, and out-of-the-box enterprise configurations like CI/CD workflows, pre-configured Git hooks, and more.

This project aims to provide developers with a collaborative, production-ready foundation for serverless application development.

## üî• Key Features

### Core Frameworks & Tools

- **SST**: Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST) is a framework that makes it easy to build serverless applications. It's designed to work with the AWS CDK and AWS SAM.
- **TSyringe**: Automatic Dependency Injection using TSyringe, a lightweight dependency injection container for TypeScript/JavaScript.
- **Prettier**: Code formatting using Prettier.
- **ESLint**: Linting using ESLint.
- **Jest**: Testing using Jest.

### Built-in Enterprise Configurations

- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD using GitHub Actions for PR verification and deployment of temporary staging environments for pull requests.
- **(Git Hooks)**: Pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting code before committing.


...You only have to fork this repository, run `sst dev` and start coding!

## üî• Key Features

### Core Frameworks & Tools
- **SST**  
  Build and manage serverless applications seamlessly using the **Serverless Stack Toolkit**, powered by AWS CDK.

- **TSyringe**  
  Use **automatic dependency injection** via TSyringe for clean, testable, and modular code without relying on a heavyweight framework like NestJS.

- **Prettier & ESLint**  
  Ensure consistent code quality with **code formatting** and **linting** using Prettier and ESLint.

- **Jest**  
  Write and run tests using Jest for reliable, maintainable code.

- **Class Transformer and Class Validator**  
  Use Class Transformer and Class Validator libraries to transform plain objects into instances and perform State validations

### Built-in Enterprise Configurations
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions Examples**  
  Pre-configured workflows for:
    - Pull Request verification.
    - Automatic deployment of **temporary staging environments**(PR Environments) for PRs.
    - Seamless automated staging deployment.
    - Automated semantic versioning and Github Releases generation

- **Git Hooks Examples**  
  - pre-commit Hook:
    - Automatic Formatting using Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting.
    - Code linting using ESLint.
    
  - commit-message Hook:
    - Enforce **Conventional Commits** for clear, semantic versioning and changelog generation.
    
  - pre-push Hook:
    - Run tests before pushing to the remote repository.


- **Conventional Commits**  
  Enforced commit message standards for clear, semantic versioning and changelog generation.

This project is meant to be a POC for the following tools:

- Using SST/Ion for Infrastructure as a code and Resource management such as API and Queues Routing, SSL, DNS, etc
- Using TSyringe for Dependency Injection without having to use a framework like NestJS
- Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD

This project in particular solves a problem for some of my other side projects
which is to provide a way to analyse images and create speech from these analysed images description,
the goal is to be using the generated data to add accessibility features to my other projects.
