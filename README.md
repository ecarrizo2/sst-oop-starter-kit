# SST OOP Starter Kit

The **SST OOP Starter Kit** is a boilerplate designed for building **enterprise-grade serverless applications**
using the **Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST)**. It incorporates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles,
lightweight **dependency injection with TSyringe**, and out-of-the-box enterprise configurations like CI/CD workflows,
pre-configured Git hooks, and more.

This project aims to provide developers with a collaborative, production-ready foundation for serverless application
development.

## üî• Key Features

### Core Frameworks & Tools

- **SST**  
  Build and manage serverless applications seamlessly using the **Serverless Stack Toolkit**, powered by AWS CDK.

- **TSyringe**  
  Use **automatic dependency injection** via TSyringe for clean, testable, and modular code without relying on a heavyweight framework like NestJS.

- **Prettier & ESLint**  
  Ensure consistent code quality with **code formatting** and **linting** using Prettier and ESLint.

- **Jest**  
  Write and run tests using Jest for reliable, maintainable code.

- **Class Transformer and Class Validator**  
  Use Class Transformer and Class Validator libraries to transform plain objects into instances and perform State validations

### Built-in Enterprise Configurations

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions Examples**  
  Pre-configured workflows for:

  - Pull Request verification to enforce code Quality.
  - Automatic deployment of **temporary staging environments**(PR Environments) for PRs.
  - Seamless automated staging deployment.
  - Automated semantic versioning and Github Releases generation
  - Dependency updates managed automatically

- **Git Hooks Examples**

  - pre-commit Hook:

    - Automatic Formatting using Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting.
    - Code linting using ESLint.

  - commit-message Hook:

    - Enforce **Conventional Commits** for clear, semantic versioning and changelog generation.

  - pre-push Hook:
    - Run tests before pushing to the remote repository.

- **Conventional Commits**  
  Enforced commit message standards for clear, semantic versioning and changelog generation.

## üåü Use Cases

This starter kit is a POC for various tools and configurations aimed at solving real-world problems, including:

- Building serverless applications with **infrastructure-as-code** capabilities for APIs, queues, SSL, DNS, and more.
- Providing an architecture to integrate **image analysis** and **speech generation**, which can power accessibility features in larger applications.
